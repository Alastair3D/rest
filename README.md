# REST

REST is a set of conventions (i.e. rules we agree to) for writing routes. Using REST will make your routes more manageable and professional-looking.

> You can play with a discovery tool [here](https://sjmog.github.io/rest/), or run it locally (see the bottom of this README).

### Learning about REST

Head to the [docs](./docs/README.md) to read all about REST.

> You might want to do this before, after, or during playing with the application.

### Running the discovery tool

#### Online

Head to https://sjmog.github.io/rest and play about. There are two exercises: 

- Understanding Resources and States, which aims to train your understanding of, well, RESTful resources and application states, and 
- 'Designing RESTful routes', which trains your ability to, er, design RESTful routes.

You can do either one in either order.

#### Locally

Clone this directory and serve the files using a static file server. For example:

```
npm install -g serve
serve
```

And head to http://localhost:5000. Or just `open index.html`.
